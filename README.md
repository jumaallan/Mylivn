## Mylivn Interview Solution

ðŸ‘€  Writing Mylivn Interview Solution App using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin, using Android Jetpack Components. 

### Prerequisites 

Before every commit, make sure you run the following commands:

```shell script
./codeAnalysis
```

To check for dependency updates, run the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew dependencyUpdate
```

Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10248), if you get any issues running the lint commands on the terminal :rocket:

### Background

Create an Android App to display a feed similar to the feed we have in Mylivn application.

The feed is the entry point of our application where we operate data from plenty of channels and display them in a beautiful UI to the users.

According to our application, users see the feed immediately after logging in. We want to impress users with a relevant, beautiful and high-performing UI, therefore feed has to be sophisticated.

## Dependencies

All the dependencies (external libraries) are defined in the single place - Gradle `buildSrc` folder. This approach allows to easily manage dependencies and use the same dependency version across all modules. 

## Some notable issues

This sections mentions some of the issues that I have come across:

- Paging (Paging 3.0) - The Marvel API doesn't support pagination, and made it hard to use Paging to paginate network requests. Room also doesn't work with the paging 3.0 library well (No paging setup on this project submission)
 
- UI Tests fail on an Emulator running API 26 (Android 8), and are successful on an Emulator running API 29 (Android 10)

- dokka documentation task doesn't work when run from the top level Mylivn task

- The spotless plugin doesn't apply the license header, and the jacoco plugin doesn't work as expected. Need more research on how to set them up using gradle plugins
